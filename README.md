# <My Online Portfolio>

## Description


- My task was to create an online portfolio so that I could display my projects to a prospective employer
- I was motivated by the idea of having a website which I could use to showcase my work and create a space of my own where my ability could be appreciated
- I made this as an ongoing project, which I will update and add to as I progress
- This page will make it easy and accessible to display my work, and in the process I learnt a lot about HTML and CSS, especially as for this project I was required to start from scratch
